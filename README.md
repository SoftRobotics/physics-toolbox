### History
The Physics Toolbox, as stored in the folder `source/originals`, was initially developed by 
Marium Zeeshan at (University of Zurich)[https://www.uzh.ch/] and then extended by 
René Bernhardsgrütter and Christoph W. Senn as part of their Bachelor's Thesis at 
(Zurich University of Applied Sciences)[http://www.zhaw.ch/] under the supervision of 
Dr. Rudolf M. Füchslin, Dr. Christian Jaeger and Dr. Helmut Hauser and in scientific 
cooperation with University of Zurich and (ETH Zurich)[https://www.ethz.ch/].
